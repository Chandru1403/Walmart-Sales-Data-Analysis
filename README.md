# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis
In this project, I used SQL to analyze a retail sales dataset, uncovering insights on sales performance, customer preferences, and product trends. Key queries include total sales by product line, revenue by month, and customer behavior based on gender and type. I also performed time-based analysis, including sales by time of day and rating patterns. This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex SQL queries for data-driven decision-making.
